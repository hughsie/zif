Version 0.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2010-09-08

Notes:
 * Zif is a simple yum-compatible library that only provides read-only
   access to the rpm database and the Fedora metadata for PackageKit.
 * Zif is not designed as a replacement to yum, or to be used by end users.

New Features:
 - Modern GObject library with GCancellation and GError
 - Full state support for accurate progress reporting
 - Remote, installed and local packages handled as abstract packages
 - Local and remote sources handled using an abstract sack
 - Self test program (248 tests)
 - Shares the yum lock
 - Uses librpm to get data from rpm
 - Reads and updates yum metadata (primary, filelists, updateinfo, other,
   metalink, mirrorlist, comps)
 - Reads standard yum repo files
 - Reads a subset of comps for distro-specific groups
 - Uses optional metalink/mirrorlist repository handling
 - Uses yum.conf main config file
 - Uses the PackageKit categories->group mapping file
