Version 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2010-10-04

New Features:
 - Avoid state warnings when doing GetCategories (Richard Hughes)
 - Return an error from zif_repos_get_store() when the repo could not be found (Richard Hughes)
 - Add zif_groups_get_cats_for_group() to get the categories for an enumerated group (Richard Hughes)
 - If we pass a full category_id ('apps;education') to zif_md_comps_get_packages_for_group() only consider the child (Richard Hughes)
 - Disable profiling by default in ZifState to speed up SearchGroup by 26% (Richard Hughes)
 - When we do zif_store_search_group() we want to use the enumerated groups, not the rpm groups (Richard Hughes)
 - Add zif_package_id_get_name() which is 9x faster than zif_package_id_split() where only the name is required (Richard Hughes)
 - Only propagate ZifState up to 1% resolution, which speeds up an incredible 18% on pretty much every action (Richard Hughes)
 - Don't trample the GError if the metadata search fails (Richard Hughes)
 - If a required metadata file does not exist, then re-download the repomd.xml and reload the store (Richard Hughes)

Notes:
 * Zif is a simple yum-compatible library that only provides read-only
   access to the rpm database and the Fedora metadata for PackageKit.
 * Zif is not designed as a replacement to yum, or to be used by end users.

New Features:
 - Modern GObject library with GCancellation and GError
 - Full state support for accurate progress reporting
 - Remote, installed and local packages handled as abstract packages
 - Local and remote sources handled using an abstract sack
 - Self test program (248 tests)
 - Shares the yum lock
 - Uses librpm to get data from rpm
 - Reads and updates yum metadata (primary, filelists, updateinfo, other,
   metalink, mirrorlist, comps)
 - Reads standard yum repo files
 - Reads a subset of comps for distro-specific groups
 - Uses optional metalink/mirrorlist repository handling
 - Uses yum.conf main config file
 - Uses the PackageKit categories->group mapping file
