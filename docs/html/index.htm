      Zif was a package manager for <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>
      written in C that was designed to replace <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/">yum</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When designing <a href="http://www.packagekit.org/">PackageKit</a>,
      I coded a framework for a distro-specific backend to
      be coupled with a distro-agnostic service that listened for user requests to
      create a package manager daemon.
    </p>

    <p>
      In doing so, I became very familiar with about a dozen (!) package systems,
      with all their specific nuances and peculiarities.
      It also became bewildering obvious to me that most of these package
      systems were not a good fit, as much of the package system functionality
      was not used and usually what PackageKit was using had to hide some
      pretty hideous hacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Zif is now a dead project.</b>
      A lot of the Zif code lives on in the hawkey backend in PackageKit,
      but there will not be any more standalone releases of Zif.
